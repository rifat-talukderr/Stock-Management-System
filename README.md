# Stock Management System
The Stock Management System is a web-based project employing a three-layer architecture. Developed using C# within the ASP.NET framework, the system utilizes a SQL Server Database for efficient data management. Design elements are enhanced with Bootstrap, JavaScript, and jQuery for an improved and responsive user interface.

# Three-Layer Architecture:

Presentation Layer (UI): This is where the user interacts with the system. In your case, it involves the web interface developed using ASP.NET, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and jQuery. Bootstrap ensures a responsive design, and JavaScript/jQuery enhance the user experience by providing dynamic and interactive features.

Business Logic Layer: Written in C#, this layer handles the core functionality of application. It contains the logic that processes data received from the presentation layer and interacts with the database layer.

Data Access Layer: Responsible for communication with the database. It involves SQL queries and database operations, likely implemented using ASP.NET or Entity Framework in C# code.

C# Programming Language: Used for the backend and business logic. C# is well-suited for developing robust, scalable, and maintainable applications.

ASP.NET Framework: This framework is employed for building web applications. ASP.NET provides a set of tools and libraries for web development, making it easier to create dynamic and feature-rich web applications.

SQL Server Database: Serves as the backend database for your application. SQL Server is widely used and integrates seamlessly with the .NET ecosystem.

Bootstrap, JavaScript, and jQuery: These front-end technologies enhance the user interface and overall user experience. Bootstrap ensures a consistent and responsive design, while JavaScript and jQuery add interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages.
