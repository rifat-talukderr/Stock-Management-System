# Stock-Management-System
The Stock Management System is a web-based project employing a three-layer architecture. Developed using C# within the ASP.NET framework, the system utilizes a SQL Server Database for efficient data management. Design elements are enhanced with Bootstrap, JavaScript, and jQuery for an improved and responsive user interface.
Three-Layer Architecture:

Presentation Layer (UI): This is where the user interacts with the system. In your case, it involves the web interface developed using ASP.NET, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and jQuery. Bootstrap ensures a responsive design, and JavaScript/jQuery enhance the user experience by providing dynamic and interactive features.

Business Logic Layer:

Written in C#, this layer handles the core functionality of your application. It contains the logic that processes data received from the presentation layer and interacts with the database layer.
Data Access Layer:

Responsible for communication with the database. It involves SQL queries and database operations, likely implemented using ADO.NET or Entity Framework in your C# code.
C# Programming Language:

Used for the backend and business logic. C# is well-suited for developing robust, scalable, and maintainable applications.
ASP.NET Framework:

This framework is employed for building web applications. ASP.NET provides a set of tools and libraries for web development, making it easier to create dynamic and feature-rich web applications.
SQL Server Database:

Serves as the backend database for your application. SQL Server is widely used and integrates seamlessly with the .NET ecosystem.
Bootstrap, JavaScript, and jQuery:

These front-end technologies enhance the user interface and overall user experience. Bootstrap ensures a consistent and responsive design, while JavaScript and jQuery add interactivity and dynamic behavior to your web pages.
In summary, your project seems well-designed, combining powerful backend technologies with a responsive and user-friendly frontend. The three-layer architecture helps maintain a separation of concerns, making your application modular and easier to maintain and scale.
